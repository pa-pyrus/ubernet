{"name":"Ubernet","tagline":"Collected documentation of UberNet webservice calls.","body":"# UberNet API #\r\nThis is an unofficial documentation of UberNet REST API calls.\r\nBy no means is it complete or entirely accurate.\r\n\r\n## Available Hosts ##\r\nThese API calls are at least available on `http://uberent.com` and `https://uberent.com`.\r\nThere is also `https://uberdevent.com` for which you probably need special credentials.\r\n\r\nThe file `cacert.pem` contains the CA certificate needed to verify the identity of `https://uberent.com`.\r\nYou only need it if your certificate store doesn't already have the *Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2* certificate.\r\n\r\n## Authentication ##\r\nIn order to use most of the service endpoints described here, you need to have a valid session ticket.\r\nSession tickets are requested from `/GC/Authenticate`.\r\nThey are a rather large string identifying your current session.\r\nThis string needs to be passed as the value of the `X-Authorization` HTTP request header for most calls.\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous ##\r\nThis section details various endpoints not belonging to a larger topic.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
