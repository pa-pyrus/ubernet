# UberNet API #
This is an unofficial documentation of UberNet REST API calls.
By no means is it complete or entirely accurate.

## Available Hosts ##
These API calls are at least available on `http://uberent.com` and `https://uberent.com`.
There is also `https://uberdevent.com` for which you probably need special credentials.

The file `cacert.pem` contains the CA certificate needed to verify the identity of `https://uberent.com`.
You only need it if your certificate store doesn't already have the *Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2* certificate.
