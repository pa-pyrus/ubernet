# UberNet API Documentation #
This is an unofficial documentation of UberNet REST API calls.
By no means is it complete or entirely accurate.

Each endpoint is documented in its own file.
All documentation is written in the Markdown dialect understood by [Python-Markdown](http://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/).
It relies on the `def_list` and `codehilite` extensions.
This also means that github will not render the files properly.
You can either generate the HTML output yourself or check (https://pa-pyrus.github.io/ubernet/).

## Respository Structure ##
* `documentation` contains the UberNet documentation in Markdown files.
* `generator` contains the resources used for generating HTML output.
* `generator/time-machine-theme` is the template used for generating HTML output.
  It is [Jon Rohan's Time Machine Theme](https://github.com/jonrohan/time-machine-theme).
